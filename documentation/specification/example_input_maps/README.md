# Sample input maps
Terragen takes in multiple geographical and sociostatistical maps as inputs to
base its procedural generation algorithms on. These are:
+ Elevation map, describing the altitude of the terrain at each point
+ Water map, describing where water is located in the terrain
+ Population density map, describing where the population of the city is distributed

The maps come in the form of greyscale images, with white typically
representing a high value, and black representing a low value.

In this folder are some unrealistic sample input maps. These were generated by
hand using image editing software. They are not representative of any city,
although they provide a good idea of what kind of data we can expect from a
real city.

These can be used to test our algorithms until we can find a real world source
for this data.
